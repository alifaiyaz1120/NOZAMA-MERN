# NOZAMA üõçÔ∏è üõí - MERN Stack Edition E-Commerce Platform

## Overview

Nozama is an online shopping platform built with the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and Node.js. Our goal is to make shopping enjoyable and user-friendly for you. The website has a modern design that works well on all devices. You can easily browse products, search for specific items, and make purchases effortlessly.

Nozama pulls product data via API calls to [Dummy JSON](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products). API calls are made in the backend which is written in ExpressJS. React Router serves as a middle man to handle client and server-side routing in our React application.

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB: Stores product and user information securely.
- ExpressJS: Handles API requests and manages server-side functions.
- ReactJS: Creates dynamic and responsive user interfaces for a seamless shopping experience.
- Node.js: Executes server-side code to support the application.
- React Router: Enables smooth navigation within the React application.
- CSS/SASS: Styles the website for an appealing look.

## Running the Application Locally:
Starting the Backend: 
```shell
cd backend

node app.js
```

Starting the Frontend: 
```shell
cd frontend

npm run start
```
- This will launch Nozama on your local machine. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to explore and enjoy a smooth shopping experience! üõí‚ú®




Nozama leverages the power of the MERN stack to ensure a robust and scalable solution. Product data is fetched from Dummy JSON through API calls handled in the ExpressJS backend. React Router is employed for efficient client and server-side routing within our React application.
